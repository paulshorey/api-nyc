But before that he produced several horror films in his native Canada, including two that would be distributed in the U.S. by AIP: the 1973 satire CANNIBAL GIRLS (screening here in February) and this decidedly uncomical rape-revenge thriller. Brenda Vaccaro stars as a model whose questionable decision to accompany a sleazy doctor to his country home suggests an inability to look after herself ? a notion that?s soon dispelled by the survival skills she summons to fend off an attacking gang of backwoods locals, led by grindhouse axiom Don Stroud. Vaccaro?s tough-as-nails performance and William Fruet?s no-nonsense direction distinguish DEATH WEEKEND as a superior exploitation thriller.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45278\"> 9:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1970, 91 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=THE%20VAMPIRE%20LOVERS%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%201\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45278&amp;t=THE%20VAMPIRE%20LOVERS%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%201\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45278\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>With Ingrid Pitt, George Cole, Kate O?Mara, and Peter Cushing.?IF YOU DARE?taste the deadly passion of the BLOOD-NYMPHS!?Though AIP bought several films from legendary British horror studio Hammer Film Productions for distribution in the U.S., THE VAMPIRE LOVERS was their only official co-production. Hammer?s fortunes were in decline at the time, its updated takes on classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy no longer seeming quite so modern in the age of increasingly sophisticated, graphic, and/or sexually explicit horror films like ROSEMARY?S BABY, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis. In this context, a partnership with AIP made perfect sense, and the result was a pioneering lesbian vampire film (these vampires go for the breast, not the neck) with the period setting and sumptuous dï¿½cor of classic Hammer horror but the ample nudity and gore that AIP could gleefully market to the drive-ins. Loosely based on a novella by gothic Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu and set in 19th century Austria, it stars Polish-born horror icon Ingrid Pitt as an identity-shifting woman who makes a habit of destroying noble families by seducing and feasting upon their nubile young maidens, and Hammer axiom Peter Cushing as the General determined to exterminate her.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45391\"> 7:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>FLAHERTY NYC, PROGRAM 2: QUEER TRANSITIONS</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=FLAHERTY%20NYC%2C%20PROGRAM%202%3A%20QUEER%20TRANSITIONS%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%202\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45391&amp;t=FLAHERTY%20NYC%2C%20PROGRAM%202%3A%20QUEER%20TRANSITIONS%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%202\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45391\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45261\">FLAHERTY NYC PRESENTS: TRANSFORMING PROVOCATIONS</a></p>\n<p>This program looks at a history and present of evolving erotic experiences of embodiment, from defiant and empowering perspectives.Marguerite Paris ALL WOMEN ARE EQUAL (1972, 15 min, 16mm)Michelle Parkerson STORME: THE LADY OF THE JEWEL BOX (1987, 21 min, 16mm)Susana Donovan BOY FRANKENSTEIN (1994, 9 min, digital)Ruth Jenrbekova &amp; Maria Vilk LAYER (2015, 21 min, digital)Yoriko Mizushiri MAKU (2014, 5 min, digital)Tara Mateik OPERATION INVERT (2003, 12 min, digital)Total running time: ca. 85 min.Tara Mateik and Michelle Parkerson in person.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45290\"> 7:15 PM</a></p>\n<p>1976, 88 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=THE%20FOOD%20OF%20THE%20GODS%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%202\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45290&amp;t=THE%20FOOD%20OF%20THE%20GODS%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%202\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45290\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>With Marjoe Gortner, Pamela Franklin, Ralph Meeker, and Ida Lupino.?H.G.

[He] plays Dr. Anton Phibes, a mysterious figure who is systematically hunting down and disposing of a team of doctors that he feels were responsible for the untimely death of his beloved wife.

Directed in a bright, colorful, and campy visual style by former art director (and frequent director of the similarly peculiar TV series THE AVENGERS) Robert Fuest, DR. PHIBES is a fast-paced, super-stylish black comedy that boasts some extremely memorable, often eerie, set pieces?.

He rose to notoriety in the early 1970s with a series of (literally) explosive art actions, before decamping to New York, where he lived until the mid-1990s. Tim Burns was a pioneer in the Super 8 New Wave in New York, producing two features, WHY CARS? ? CARnage (1977) and POLITICAL TRANSMISSION (1978). He was deeply involved with the film and theater community downtown at that time, participating in the Nightshift Theater, Collaborative Projects, and Variety Motion Pictures. Working in various media ? film, video, theater, installation, painting, books ? over the last forty years, Burns sets up situations that critically reflect on our hypermediated, industrialized western society.

The story of a deranged, Necronomicon-obsessed man with an identical twin who may or may not have died at birth, DUNWICH is distinguished by its bizarre cast: it stars fading ingï¿½nue Sandra Dee (GIDGET, IMITATION OF LIFE), distinguished character actor Ed Begley (in his last screen role), and child actor-turned-countercultural luminary-turned TV star Dean Stockwell, who gives an unforgettably creepy performance (almost as memorable as his indelible appearance in BLUE VELVET).PLEASE NOTE: We're sorry to report that the print of DUNWICH HORROR that was provided to us is badly faded; we apologize for any inconvenience.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45251\"> 4:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>With Russian intertitles, English synopsis available, 1926, 74 min, 35mm, b&amp;w, silent                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=EC%3A%20A%20SIXTH%20OF%20THE%20WORLD%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%206\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45251&amp;t=EC%3A%20A%20SIXTH%20OF%20THE%20WORLD%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%206\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45251\">URL</a></p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45291\"> 5:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1976, 88 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=THE%20FOOD%20OF%20THE%20GODS%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%206\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45291&amp;t=THE%20FOOD%20OF%20THE%20GODS%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%206\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45291\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>With Marjoe Gortner, Pamela Franklin, Ralph Meeker, and Ida Lupino.?H.G.

He rose to notoriety in the early 1970s with a series of (literally) explosive art actions, before decamping to New York, where he lived until the mid-1990s. Tim Burns was a pioneer in the Super 8 New Wave in New York, producing two features, WHY CARS? ? CARnage (1977) and POLITICAL TRANSMISSION (1978). He was deeply involved with the film and theater community downtown at that time, participating in the Nightshift Theater, Collaborative Projects, and Variety Motion Pictures.

[Actor Lindzee] Smith is laid up in a New York hospital, his immune system ravaged by rampaging anti-bodies. Smith?s political diatribe heard voice-off is a didactic call to arms in response to a rise in fascism: an unhealthy political ideology attempting to overthrow a healthy social system.? ?Tony Reck, REAL TIMEALPHABET CITY / THUS WENT PHILLIPA1981, 25 min, Super 8mm-to-digitalThis film is a documentary drama about heroin addicts in a Lower East Side apartment, based on a play called ?The Needle Vestal? by Sinclair Beiles, a beatnik compatriot of Ginsberg, Burroughs, and Kerouac.?Burns shows a bunch of his friends shooting up in a Lower East Side apartment. Ranging from ?look how disgusting you look nodding out? verite shooting to formal montages of arms, needles, and hands, the film is an intense moment-to-moment improvisation around the problem of depicting something you are right in the middle of and that scares you to death.? ?Amy Taubin, SOHO NEWS</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45287\"> 7:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1970, 95 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=SCREAM%20AND%20SCREAM%20AGAIN%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%206\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45287&amp;t=SCREAM%20AND%20SCREAM%20AGAIN%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%206\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45287\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>With Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, and Peter Cushing.?TRIPLE DISTILLED HORROR?as powerful as a vat of boiling ACID!?SCREAM AND SCREAM AGAIN would be a must-see if only for its one-time-only, dream-team pairing of horror icons Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, and Peter Cushing (though the three are never onscreen all at once). But far from a gimmicky, victory-lap celebration, SCREAM is one of the best, most unusual horror movies of the period. A genuinely chilling film with an intriguing, three-stranded narrative, it centers on a police inspector investigating a pair of ?vampire murders? who discovers that terrifying human experiments are being performed by a maniacal doctor (Price). Though its three stars made their names as paragons of gothic horror, SCREAM transplants them into the realm of the 1970s political thriller, combining elements of horror, sci-fi, and conspiracy-theory cinema, and hinging on an astonishing, 10-minute-long chase scene through the streets of London.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45399\"> 8:15 PM</a></p>\n<p>SHOW &amp; TELL: TIM BURNS, PGM. 3</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=SHOW%20%26%20TELL%3A%20TIM%20BURNS%2C%20PGM.%203%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%206\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45399&amp;t=SHOW%20%26%20TELL%3A%20TIM%20BURNS%2C%20PGM.%203%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%206\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45399\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45264\">SHOW &amp; TELL: TIMOTHY GERAGHTY / TIM BURNS / KATE MCCABE</a></p>\n<p>Tim Burns is a legendary figure in the history of Australian underground art.

Hammer?s fortunes were in decline at the time, its updated takes on classic characters like Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy no longer seeming quite so modern in the age of increasingly sophisticated, graphic, and/or sexually explicit horror films like ROSEMARY?S BABY, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and the work of Herschell Gordon Lewis. In this context, a partnership with AIP made perfect sense, and the result was a pioneering lesbian vampire film (these vampires go for the breast, not the neck) with the period setting and sumptuous dï¿½cor of classic Hammer horror but the ample nudity and gore that AIP could gleefully market to the drive-ins. Loosely based on a novella by gothic Irish writer Sheridan Le Fanu and set in 19th century Austria, it stars Polish-born horror icon Ingrid Pitt as an identity-shifting woman who makes a habit of destroying noble families by seducing and feasting upon their nubile young maidens, and Hammer axiom Peter Cushing as the General determined to exterminate her.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45252\"> 4:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>With Russian intertitles, English synopsis available, 1928, 60 min, 35mm, b&amp;w, silent                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=EC%3A%20THE%20ELEVENTH%20YEAR%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%207\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45252&amp;t=EC%3A%20THE%20ELEVENTH%20YEAR%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%207\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45252\">URL</a></p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45299\"> 5:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1971, 93 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=THE%20ABOMINABLE%20DR.%20PHIBES%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%20%207\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45299&amp;t=THE%20ABOMINABLE%20DR.%20PHIBES%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%20%207\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45299\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>With Vincent Price &amp; Joseph Cotten.?LOVE MEANS NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU?RE UGLY.??Vincent Price stars in what is, quite possibly, the ultimate ?Vincent Price? movie, one that practically cemented the actor?s public and professional identity as the actual personification of all things horror. [He] plays Dr. Anton Phibes, a mysterious figure who is systematically hunting down and disposing of a team of doctors that he feels were responsible for the untimely death of his beloved wife. [?] The gimmick here is that Phibes dispatches his victims in a spectacular variety of gruesome and bizarre ways, all of which are based on ten biblical curses. Directed in a bright, colorful, and campy visual style by former art director (and frequent director of the similarly peculiar TV series THE AVENGERS) Robert Fuest, DR. PHIBES is a fast-paced, super-stylish black comedy that boasts some extremely memorable, often eerie, set pieces?. Possessing a particularly gleeful and nasty sense of humor, the movie, set in the mid-1920s, comes across almost like a live action version of the artwork of Edward Gorey.? ?

But before that he produced several horror films in his native Canada, including two that would be distributed in the U.S. by AIP: the 1973 satire CANNIBAL GIRLS (screening here in February) and this decidedly uncomical rape-revenge thriller. Brenda Vaccaro stars as a model whose questionable decision to accompany a sleazy doctor to his country home suggests an inability to look after herself ? a notion that?s soon dispelled by the survival skills she summons to fend off an attacking gang of backwoods locals, led by grindhouse axiom Don Stroud. Vaccaro?s tough-as-nails performance and William Fruet?s no-nonsense direction distinguish DEATH WEEKEND as a superior exploitation thriller.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45351\"> 6:00 PM</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=NEWFILMMAKERS%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2010\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45351&amp;t=NEWFILMMAKERS%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2010\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45351\">URL</a></p>\n<p>For full program listings, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.newfilmmakers.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.newfilmmakers.com</a>.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45513\"> 7:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>WE WON'T GROW OLD TOGETHER (digital)</p>\n<p>In French with English subtitles, 1972, 110 min, 35mm-to-digital                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=WE%20WON%27T%20GROW%20OLD%20TOGETHER%20%28digital%29%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2011\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45513&amp;t=WE%20WON%27T%20GROW%20OLD%20TOGETHER%20%28digital%29%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2011\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45513\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45324\">VALENTINE?S DAY MASSACRE 2016</a></p>\n<p>(NOUS NE VIEILLIRONS PAS ENSEMBLE)With Jean Yanne &amp; Marlene Joubert.?Far  from viewer-friendly, [this film] tells the story of the endless  breakups and makeups of a highly unstable yet apparently indissoluble  couple.

In Japanese with English subtitles.\"I grew up in post-war Japan, devouring the works of those who experienced WWII. Popular entertainment, from movies to manga, were also suffused with memories of the War. Without experiencing the War, our generation were influenced by the grotesqueness of massive violence. Soon after 9/11, I began thinking about how dying in mass violence is different from dying from a disease or an accident. Why does it matter how we die? Then I realized that, however painful the process of dying, one who dies a personal death at least dies his or her own death. A personal death receives personal attention. Dying in the midst of massive violence means dying amid widespread suffering ? it deprives a person of his or her own personal death. Mizushima, the protagonist of THE BURMESE HARP witnesses countless corpses as he wanders through Burma. Fear, remorse, and hesitation gradually transform this survivor into a mourner. Wishing to attend and bury the dead, he ultimately tells himself, 'I cannot return to Japan.' Director Ichikawa described THE BURMESE HARP as the first film he felt a profound need to make.\" ?EikoWith:Eiko &amp; Koma and James Byrne UNDERTOW (1988, 7 min, 16mm b&amp;w)UNDERTOW is a work choreographed for the camera in collaboration with video artist James Byrne.

Film Form Workshop, which peaked in the 1970s. However, a recent book entitled THE STRUGGLE FOR FORM argues that a distinctive strain of moving image experimentation by Polish artists began as early as 1916 and continued at least until 1989 when their works began to merge into a globalized ?art world.?In concert with his review of THE STRUGGLE FOR FORM, published in the most recent issue of the Millennium Film Journal (MFJ 62), Andrzej Jachimczyk has curated this special one-program survey of Polish avant-garde cinema, beginning with a 1937 film by the Themersons and a formal experiment by Andrzej Paw?owski, followed by an example of the Moral Angst Cinema by Wojciech Wiszniewski and two films made under the auspices of the Film Form Workshop. The third part of the program contains an existential contemplation by Andrzej Klimowski and a social critique by Hieronim Neumann, and ends with a 1997 documentary by the film visionary Kazimierz Karabasz. Though Polish avant-garde cinema is often considered to embrace a rigidly formalist position, this program suggests that changes in political climate have as significant an influence as aesthetic prerogatives on the methods and ideas of moving image artists. Though none of the works can be definitively categorized, the program includes fictional, animation, and documentary approaches to film.For more info on the Millennium Film Journal, visit www. mfj-online.org.Presented in collaboration with the Polish Cultural Institute New York.

WITH LUST and LEMON HEARTS), while he later directed the Terence Malick-scripted trucker comedy DEADHEAD MILES (the first feature film for which Malick earned a credit). In between, he made this gleefully over-the-top portrait of the roller derby scene for AIP, a masterpiece of calculated bad taste that he called ?GUN CRAZY on wheels.??UNHOLY ROLLERS is so bad it?s good. The film flaunts its uninhibited love for everything decent folk call Bad Taste: traveling salesmen jokes, tufted velvet sofas, STP decals, greaser rock, suede hot pants, vinyl boots ? and roller derbies. Zimmerman?s treatment of the derby subculture is realistic in spirit and zest ? but not in detail. UNHOLY ROLLERS is an exuberant, rococo, preposterous exaggeration of the skating lifestyle. [?] Zimmerman?s approach is that of a physician giving electroshock treatments to a cadaver. He keeps hyping the trite and familiar exploitation plot with jolts of gratuitous sex and violence, vulgar wisecracking, incongruous actions, riotous sounds and colors. And in the end Zimmerman?s shock treatments are much more exciting than the forgettable story line, and, in fact, give the film a unique personality.

Borden has  created a small but explosive body of work that challenges viewers to  rethink their assumptions about gender, sexuality, race, and class.After  majoring in art history at Wellesley College, Borden moved to NYC where  she originally aspired to be a painter and wrote for Artforum Magazine.  She began her filmmaking career by creating the soundtrack for Richard  Serra?s documentary, STEELMILL. Borden?s first feature was REGROUPING  (1976), about a women?s consciousness-raising group. The homogeneity of  race and class in the group led her to embark on BORN IN FLAMES, while  her interest in the sex industry and labor resulted in WORKING GIRLS  (1986), an un-romanticized look at a middle-class brothel in Manhattan.  Borden landed in movie jail with her studio-recut, erotic thriller LOVE  CRIMES (1992), but has since directed several TV episodes, including RED  SHOE DIARIES and Propaganda Film?s INSIDE OUT, starring Alexis  Arquette, Joe Dallesandro, and Mary Woronov.For her RE-VISIONS  program, we?re overjoyed to premiere our brand-new 35mm preservation of  BORN IN FLAMES, alongside very rare screenings of her debut feature,  REGROUPING, presented in collaboration with the Outfest UCLA Legacy  Project.REGROUPING1976, 80 min, 16mm, b&amp;w.

Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45379\"> 7:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1973, 77 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=HEAVY%20TRAFFIC%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2020\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45379&amp;t=HEAVY%20TRAFFIC%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2020\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45379\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>?More spice?from the makers of FRITZ THE CAT.??Ralph Bakshi moves beyond the ersatz animalism of Fritz the Cat to the real-life animalism of New York?s Lower East Side in this hilarious, grotesque cartoon/live-action feature, a pinball player?s fantasy equivalent of Hubert Selby?s LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN.

WITH LUST and LEMON HEARTS), while he later directed the Terence Malick-scripted trucker comedy DEADHEAD MILES (the first feature film for which Malick earned a credit). In between, he made this gleefully over-the-top portrait of the roller derby scene for AIP, a masterpiece of calculated bad taste that he called ?GUN CRAZY on wheels.??UNHOLY ROLLERS is so bad it?s good. The film flaunts its uninhibited love for everything decent folk call Bad Taste: traveling salesmen jokes, tufted velvet sofas, STP decals, greaser rock, suede hot pants, vinyl boots ? and roller derbies. Zimmerman?s treatment of the derby subculture is realistic in spirit and zest ? but not in detail. UNHOLY ROLLERS is an exuberant, rococo, preposterous exaggeration of the skating lifestyle. [?] Zimmerman?s approach is that of a physician giving electroshock treatments to a cadaver. He keeps hyping the trite and familiar exploitation plot with jolts of gratuitous sex and violence, vulgar wisecracking, incongruous actions, riotous sounds and colors. And in the end Zimmerman?s shock treatments are much more exciting than the forgettable story line, and, in fact, give the film a unique personality.

In Polish with English subtitles.We all come from water and water courses through our bodies. We are a bubble floating down the river of life to the unknown. Water is both a source of life and a threat. When water becomes a menace to our lives and senses, our existence is truly frightened.KANAL follows a near-decimated company of Polish resistance fighters as they make a final effort to escape the encircling Nazis through the sewers of Warsaw. A merciless view of their flight through the putrid waters, KANAL is a story void of glory and nearly void of hope, where the desire for dignity, even survival, becomes faint. Wajda was an important figure for our youth in Japan. When Eiko &amp; Koma performed in the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology in 2007, founded by Wajda in Krakow, Poland, we had the pleasure of meeting the filmmaker and telling him how his ASHES AND DIAMONDS had had a special meaning for those of us who were student fighters in the political movements of the late ?60s. His KANAL inspired Koma and me in 1989 to create the work, CANAL, a work for several naked bodies, whose stage design suggested both urban sewers and the blood stream of a body.With:Eiko &amp; Koma WALLOW (1984, 19 min, video)WALLOW was our first attempt to create dance for a camera, shot in Point Reyes, California.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45320\"> 7:15 PM, </a></p>\n<p><a name=\"showing-45321\"> 9:15 PM</a></p>\n<p>1983, 85 min, 16mm-to-35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=RE-VISIONS%3A%20BORN%20IN%20FLAMES%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2024\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45321&amp;t=RE-VISIONS%3A%20BORN%20IN%20FLAMES%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2024\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45321\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45267\">RE-VISIONS: AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL FILM 1975-90</a></p>\n<p>PREMIERE RUN ?

Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson.</p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45322\"> 7:15 PM, </a></p>\n<p><a name=\"showing-45323\"> 9:15 PM</a></p>\n<p>1983, 85 min, 16mm-to-35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=RE-VISIONS%3A%20BORN%20IN%20FLAMES%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2025\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45323&amp;t=RE-VISIONS%3A%20BORN%20IN%20FLAMES%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2025\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45323\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45267\">RE-VISIONS: AMERICAN EXPERIMENTAL FILM 1975-90</a></p>\n<p>PREMIERE RUN ?

Featuring performances from Kathryn Bigelow, Adele Bertei, and Ron Vawter, and a fantastic theme song by The Red Krayola, BORN IN FLAMES examines the extremist agendas of two different feminist groups as they strategize, debate, take up arms, and form a true Women?s Army. The film swings between various protagonists and political viewpoints, creating an inclusive atmosphere that allows for a larger, very real political discussion to develop.Anthology Film Archives is proud to present this brand new 35mm preservation print produced as part of a multi-year restoration project supported by the Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Filmed on a hodgepodge of 16mm camera stocks over a number of years, the original footage for this crucial film has long been lost. Working from a damaged original 16mm internegative we have managed to create this pristine restoration, a vast improvement on older exhibition copies.?BORN IN FLAMES still maintains the legendary status it reached even before its completion. Four years in the making, shot by a half-dozen cinematographers on a shoestring budget using ?real people? (who age and change hairdo from one shot to the next) and real locations, and mixing pop music black rhythms and ?new rock?, improvised acting, political speeches, humor and violence, the film had a cult following as soon as it was screened in Berlin, Paris, and New York.? ?Berenice Reynaud, ?Difficult Language: Notes on Independent Cinema by Women in the Eighties?This week-long revival run is presented as part of our ongoing series, RE-VISIONS, which will also include a screening of Lizzie Borden's earlier film, REGROUPING; click <a href=\"../../../film_screenings/series/45267\">here</a> for more info about RE-VISIONS, and <a href=\"../../../film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=02&amp;year=2016#showing-45401\">here</a> for REGROUPING.Also, please note that Lizzie Borden will be here in person on opening night, Friday, February 19, for a special talk following the 7:15 screening; she'll be joined by two of the stars of BORN IN FLAMES, Adele Bertei and Jeanne Satterfield.Our neighbors <a href=\"http://bluestockings.com\">Bluestockings Bookstore</a>, one of the last remaining feminist bookstores in America, will be at opening night, February 19th, selling books and a selection of other items like pins, patches and tote bags!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://borninflames.bpt.me/\" target=\"_blank\">A limited number of advance tickets are&nbsp;available&nbsp;now!</a></p>\n","img":{}},{"body":"<p><a name=\"showing-45380\"> 9:00 PM</a></p>\n<p>1973, 77 min, 35mm                                                        Share +</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/?status=HEAVY%20TRAFFIC%20at%20@anthologyfilm%20on%20February%2025\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fanthologyfilmarchives.org%2Ffilm_screenings%2Fcalendar%3Fview%3Dlist%26month%3D2%26year%3D2016%23showing-45380&amp;t=HEAVY%20TRAFFIC%20at%20Anthology%20Film%20Archives%20on%20February%2025\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&amp;month=2&amp;year=2016#showing-45380\">URL</a></p>\n<p>This screening is part of: <a href=\"/film_screenings/series/45275\">AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL PICTURES, PART 3</a></p>\n<p>?More spice?from the makers of FRITZ THE CAT.??Ralph Bakshi moves beyond the ersatz animalism of Fritz the Cat to the real-life animalism of New York?s Lower East Side in this hilarious, grotesque cartoon/live-action feature, a pinball player?s fantasy equivalent of Hubert Selby?s LAST EXIT TO BROOKLYN.

WITH LUST and LEMON HEARTS), while he later directed the Terence Malick-scripted trucker comedy DEADHEAD MILES (the first feature film for which Malick earned a credit). In between, he made this gleefully over-the-top portrait of the roller derby scene for AIP, a masterpiece of calculated bad taste that he called ?GUN CRAZY on wheels.??UNHOLY ROLLERS is so bad it?s good. The film flaunts its uninhibited love for everything decent folk call Bad Taste: traveling salesmen jokes, tufted velvet sofas, STP decals, greaser rock, suede hot pants, vinyl boots ? and roller derbies. Zimmerman?s treatment of the derby subculture is realistic in spirit and zest ? but not in detail. UNHOLY ROLLERS is an exuberant, rococo, preposterous exaggeration of the skating lifestyle. [?] Zimmerman?s approach is that of a physician giving electroshock treatments to a cadaver. He keeps hyping the trite and familiar exploitation plot with jolts of gratuitous sex and violence, vulgar wisecracking, incongruous actions, riotous sounds and colors. And in the end Zimmerman?s shock treatments are much more exciting than the forgettable story line, and, in fact, give the film a unique personality.

Price is a mid-nineteenth century millionaire whose admirable quest to eliminate war and conflict from the globe is undercut by his curious strategy for achieving peace: to use his self-constructed airship to bomb all military installations to smithereens. Eager to consolidate its newfound respectability, AIP devoted its largest budget to date to MASTER OF THE WORLD, while entrusting the project to the under-appreciated journeyman William Witney (today a favorite of Quentin Tarantino?s). The result is a strange combination of big-budget spectacle and typical AIP corner-cutting, and ultimately a fascinating film, both for its paradoxical portrait of a mad peacenik and for the bizarre clash between the disparate acting styles of Price and Bronson.</p>\n","img":{}}],"meta":{"url":"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&month={{date:MM}}&year={{date:YYYY}}#day-{{date:DD}}","name":"Anthology Film Archives","category":[{"url":"film","name":"Film","id":"knmIntmg488GEUMec4coU"}],"eItem":".film-showing","eChildren":{"date":".prevAll('.current-day').first()","title":".find('.film-title')","subtitle":".find('.showing-details').clone().children().remove().end()","summary":".find('.film-notes')"},"iSubtitle":{"leftover":""},"iLink":{"find":".envelope a"},"iSummary":{"find":".film-notes"},"iDate":{"prev":".current-day"},"id":"lan9AiCv3qCo0GeGI6MwU","link":"http://anthologyfilmarchives.org/film_screenings/calendar?view=list&month=02&year=2016#day-17"}}
